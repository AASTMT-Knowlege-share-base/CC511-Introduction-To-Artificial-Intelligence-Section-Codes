# Random Forest Classification: Overview

Random Forest is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both **classification** and **regression** tasks. It is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions, improving accuracy and robustness compared to a single tree.

## Key Features

1. **Ensemble Learning**:
   - Random Forest builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions through voting (classification) or averaging (regression).

2. **Randomization**:
   - Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data (bootstrap sampling).
   - At each split, a random subset of features is considered for splitting.

3. **Feature Importance**:
   - Random Forest can rank the importance of features in making predictions.

4. **Handles Overfitting**:
   - By aggregating the predictions of multiple trees, Random Forest reduces overfitting compared to a single decision tree.

## Advantages

1. **High Accuracy**:
   - Effective for both classification and regression problems.

2. **Handles Non-linear Relationships**:
   - Works well with complex datasets.

3. **Robustness**:
   - Less sensitive to noise and overfitting due to ensemble averaging.

4. **Feature Importance**:
   - Identifies which features are most important for predictions.

## Disadvantages

1. **Complexity**:
   - Slower to train and predict compared to a single decision tree due to the ensemble approach.

2. **Interpretability**:
   - More difficult to interpret than a single decision tree.

3. **Resource Intensive**:
   - Requires more computational resources for large datasets.
