### Problem Overview
We are tasked with solving a murder case involving three suspects: Adams (A), Brown (B), and Clark (C). The following information is given:
1. Adams, Brown, and Clark each claim they did not commit the murder.
2. Two innocent suspects are truthful, while the guilty suspect might not be truthful.
3. Exactly one suspect is guilty.

---

### Logical Translation of Statements
We translate each suspect's statement into propositional logic:

#### Adams’ Statement:
- "I didn’t do it." → \( \neg G_A \)
- "The victim was an old acquaintance of Brown’s." → \( F(B, V) \)
- "Clark hated the victim." → \( H(C, V) \)

Thus:
\[
\neg G_A \rightarrow (F(B, V) \land H(C, V))
\]

#### Brown’s Statement:
- "I didn’t do it." → \( \neg G_B \)
- "I didn’t know the guy." → \( \neg K(B, V) \)
- "I was out of town all week." → \( O(B) \)

Thus:
\[
\neg G_B \rightarrow (\neg K(B, V) \land O(B))
\]

#### Clark’s Statement:
- "I didn’t do it." → \( \neg G_C \)
- "I saw both Adams and Brown downtown with the victim that day." → \( W(A, V) \land W(B, V) \)
- "One of them must have done it." → \( G_A \lor G_B \)

Thus:
\[
\neg G_C \rightarrow ((W(A, V) \land W(B, V)) \land (G_A \lor G_B))
\]

---

### Logical Framework
1. **Key assumption**: Two innocent suspects tell the truth; the guilty suspect may lie.
2. **Exclusive OR**: Exactly one suspect is guilty:
\[
G_A \oplus G_B \oplus G_C
\]

---

### Case Analysis
We analyze each possibility (\( G_A, G_B, G_C \)) assuming only one suspect is guilty and check for logical consistency.

#### Case 1: Adams is Guilty (\( G_A \))
- Adams' statement is unreliable.
- Brown (\( \neg G_B \)) and Clark (\( \neg G_C \)) are innocent:
  - Brown’s statement is true:
    \[
    \neg K(B, V) \land O(B)
    \]
  - Clark’s statement is true:
    \[
    W(A, V) \land W(B, V) \land (G_A \lor G_B)
    \]

**Contradiction**: If Clark is truthful, \( G_A \lor G_B \) cannot hold because \( G_A \) is true, making Clark's statement invalid.

Thus, **Adams cannot be guilty**.

---

#### Case 2: Brown is Guilty (\( G_B \))
- Brown's statement is unreliable.
- Adams (\( \neg G_A \)) and Clark (\( \neg G_C \)) are innocent:
  - Adams' statement is true:
    \[
    F(B, V) \land H(C, V)
    \]
  - Clark’s statement is true:
    \[
    W(A, V) \land W(B, V) \land (G_A \lor G_B)
    \]

No contradictions arise. Thus, **Brown can be guilty**.

---

#### Case 3: Clark is Guilty (\( G_C \))
- Clark's statement is unreliable.
- Adams (\( \neg G_A \)) and Brown (\( \neg G_B \)) are innocent:
  - Adams’ statement is true:
    \[
    F(B, V) \land H(C, V)
    \]
  - Brown’s statement is true:
    \[
    \neg K(B, V) \land O(B)
    \]

**Contradiction**: If Clark is guilty, \( W(A, V) \land W(B, V) \) (Clark’s observation) cannot be true, as both Adams and Brown are innocent.

Thus, **Clark cannot be guilty**.

---

### Conclusion
The only consistent case is when **Brown (B)** is guilty. Therefore, the guilty party is **Brown**.
