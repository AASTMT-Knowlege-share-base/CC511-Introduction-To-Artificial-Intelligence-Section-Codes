# Unsupervised Machine Learning: PCA and K-Means

## Introduction to Unsupervised Machine Learning
Unsupervised Machine Learning is a type of machine learning where the model learns patterns and structures from data without any labeled outputs. The goal is to discover hidden structures, relationships, or groups within the data. Unlike supervised learning, where the output is predefined, unsupervised learning identifies insights based solely on the input data.

### Common Use Cases of Unsupervised Learning:
- Clustering (grouping data points based on similarity)
- Dimensionality Reduction (reducing the number of features while retaining significant information)
- Anomaly Detection (identifying outliers)
- Data Preprocessing (cleaning and preparing data for other tasks)

Two popular techniques in unsupervised learning are **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and **K-Means Clustering**.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique used to simplify large datasets while preserving as much information as possible. It is particularly useful for visualization, noise reduction, and speeding up machine learning models.

### How PCA Works:
1. **Standardization**: The data is standardized to ensure all features contribute equally.
2. **Covariance Matrix**: Compute the covariance matrix to identify relationships between features.
3. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: Calculate eigenvalues (variance explained) and eigenvectors (principal components).
4. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Select the top principal components that capture the most variance and project the data onto these components.

### Key Features:
- Reduces dimensionality while retaining important information.
- Transforms data into uncorrelated components (principal components).
- Helps with visualization and preprocessing.

### Example Applications:
- Visualizing high-dimensional datasets in 2D or 3D.
- Noise reduction in datasets.
- Compression of data for faster computations.

### Advantages:
- Simplifies data and reduces computational overhead.
- Removes multicollinearity by transforming correlated features into uncorrelated components.

### Limitations:
- Only captures linear relationships; non-linear patterns may be missed.
- Interpretation of principal components can be challenging.

## K-Means Clustering
K-Means is a clustering algorithm used to group data points into \( K \) clusters based on their similarity. It is widely used for pattern recognition and segmentation tasks.

### How K-Means Works:
1. **Initialization**: Randomly select \( K \) data points as initial centroids.
2. **Assignment**: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid to form \( K \) clusters.
3. **Update Centroids**: Calculate the mean of the data points in each cluster to update centroids.
4. **Iterative Optimization**: Repeat the assignment and update steps until centroids stabilize or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

### Key Features:
- Divides data into non-overlapping clusters.
- Uses Euclidean distance to measure similarity.
- Minimizes intra-cluster variance and maximizes inter-cluster distance.

### Example Applications:
- Customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior.
- Image compression by reducing colors.
- Grouping documents or articles into related topics.

### Advantages:
- Simple and fast to implement.
- Scalable to large datasets.

### Limitations:
- Requires specifying the number of clusters (\( K \)) beforehand.
- Sensitive to initialization and outliers.
- Assumes clusters have spherical shapes and similar sizes.

| Output                    | Transformed Data (Components) | Cluster Assignments         |
| Type of Analysis          | Linear relationships        | Group similarity            |
| Dependency on \( K \)      | No                         | Yes (number of clusters)    |
| Applications              | Visualization, Noise Reduction | Segmentation, Grouping     |

## Conclusion
Both PCA and K-Means are powerful tools in unsupervised machine learning, serving different purposes. PCA is ideal for simplifying data and identifying significant patterns, while K-Means is excellent for grouping similar data points into clusters. Combining these methods can also be effective, such as using PCA for dimensionality reduction before applying K-Means for clustering.
