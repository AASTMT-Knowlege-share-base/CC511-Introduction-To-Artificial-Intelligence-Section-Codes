# Linear Regression: Overview

Linear Regression is one of the simplest and most commonly used machine learning algorithms for solving **regression problems**. It establishes a relationship between a **dependent variable (target)** and one or more **independent variables (features)** using a straight line.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Simple Linear Regression
- Involves one independent variable.
- Equation: 
  \[
  Y = mX + b
  \]
  Where:
  - \( Y \): Dependent variable (predicted value).
  - \( X \): Independent variable (input feature).
  - \( m \): Slope of the line (weight).
  - \( b \): Intercept (bias).

### 2. Multiple Linear Regression
- Involves multiple independent variables.
- Equation: 
  \[
  Y = m_1X_1 + m_2X_2 + \dots + b
  \]

### 3. Objective
- Minimize the difference between the predicted values (\( \hat{Y} \)) and the actual values (\( Y \)).
- Achieved using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** as the loss function:
  \[
  MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \hat{Y}_i)^2
  \]

### 4. Key Advantages of Linear Regression

- Simple and interpretable.
- Works well for linearly related data.
- Provides coefficients (slope and intercept) that help understand the impact of each feature.

### 5. Disadvantages of Linear Regression

While Linear Regression is a simple and interpretable model, it has several limitations:

1. **Assumption of Linearity**:
   - Linear Regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. If the relationship is non-linear, the model will perform poorly.

2. **Sensitivity to Outliers**:
   - Outliers in the dataset can significantly influence the regression line and lead to inaccurate predictions.

3. **Overfitting in High Dimensions**:
   - In cases of high-dimensional data (many features), Linear Regression can overfit the training data, leading to poor generalization on new data.

4. **Limited Applicability for Complex Problems**:
   - Linear Regression is not suitable for complex datasets with:
     - Non-linear patterns.
     - Interactions between variables.

5. **No Automatic Feature Selection**:
   - Linear Regression uses all input features and does not inherently identify which features are most important for prediction.

6. **Prone to Underfitting**:
   - Because it is a simple model, it might fail to capture the underlying trends of more complex datasets, leading to underfitting.
